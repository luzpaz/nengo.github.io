Using the book as a text
************************

Given the practical nature of much of the material in the book,
it can be used quite successfully as a textbook
for a course on cognitive or neural modelling.
The material below will assist instructors in running such a course.

.. note:: If you are looking for something specific
          (e.g. specific slides, images, code, etc.),
          please do not hesitate to contact
          `Chris Eliasmith <mailto:celiasmith@uwaterloo.ca>`_.

Suggested lecture schedule
==========================

I've provided more lectures
than I believe you can fit in a single term.
However, this allows lecturers to
add and remove topics as they see fit,
or change the emphasis of a particular version of the course.
I'm assuming that each lecture is
3 hours (i.e. a typical week's worth of material).

Assignment details
==================

The assignments above mirror those in the book.
It is also useful to ask questions
about the functioning of the models being built,
and to ask students to change the models slightly
to examine different aspects of neural/cognitive processing.
The intent of this section of the website
is to provide examples of such questions,
as we develop them.
`Suggestions welcome <forum_>`_.

Suggested projects
==================

* Build a creature to seek food and return to a home nest.

* Build a serial working memory model that allows for loading, reset, etc.

* Build a robot controller for a robot
  that you present instructions to,
  that it memorizes and then executes.

* Build an adaptive controller for a 3-link arm
  using Slotine's adaptation methods.

* Build a model that does any one of the tasks in Spaun.

* Build something on the `modelling ideas list <ideas_>`_.

If you have a project suggestions,
please add it to the `modelling ideas list <ideas_>`_,
or post it `on the forum <forum_>`_.
