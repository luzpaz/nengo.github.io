<h4>2.1 Copyright Assignment<a class="headerlink" href="#copyright-assignment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>At the time the Contribution is Submitted, You assign to Us all
right, title, and interest worldwide in all Copyright covering the
Contribution; provided that this transfer is conditioned upon
compliance with Section 2.3.</li>
<li>To the extent that any of the rights in Section 2.1(a) cannot be
assigned by You to Us, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide,
exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable license under
such non-assigned rights, with rights to sublicense through
multiple tiers of sublicensees, to practice such non-assigned
rights, including, but not limited to, the right to reproduce,
modify, display, perform and distribute the Contribution; provided
that this license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.</li>
<li>To the extent that any of the rights in Section 2.1(a) can neither
be assigned nor licensed by You to Us, You irrevocably waive and
agree never to assert such rights against Us, any of our
successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or
indirect; provided that this agreement not to assert is
conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.</li>
<li>Upon such transfer of rights to Us, to the maximum extent
possible, We immediately grant to You a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable license
under such rights covering the Contribution, with rights to
sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to reproduce,
modify, display, perform, and distribute the Contribution. The
intention of the parties is that this license will be as broad as
possible and to provide You with rights as similar as possible to
the owner of the rights that You transferred. This license back is
limited to the Contribution and does not provide any rights to the
Material.</li>

apparatus claims which You own, control or have the right to grant,
now or in the future, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license,
with the right to sublicense these rights to multiple tiers of
sublicensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import
and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Contribution in
combination with the Material (and portions of such combination). This
license is granted only to the extent that the exercise of the
licensed rights infringes such patent claims; and provided that this
license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.</p>

Your Contribution in a Material, We may license the Contribution under
any license, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or
proprietary licenses. As a condition on the exercise of this right, We
agree to also license the Contribution under the terms of the license
or licenses which We are using for the Material on the Submission
Date.</p>

<h3>6. Miscellaneous<a class="headerlink" href="#miscellaneous" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>6.1</strong> This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of Ontario, Canada excluding its conflicts of law
provisions. Under certain circumstances, the governing law in this
section might be superseded by the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (“UN Convention”) and the
parties intend to avoid the application of the UN Convention to this
Agreement and, thus, exclude the application of the UN Convention in its
entirety to this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>6.2</strong> This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and
Us for Your Contributions to Us and overrides all other agreements or
understandings.</p>
<p><strong>6.3</strong> If You or We assign the rights or obligations received through
this Agreement to a third party, as a condition of the assignment,
that third party must agree in writing to abide by all the rights and
obligations in the Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>6.4</strong> The failure of either party to require performance by the
other party of any provision of this Agreement in one situation shall
not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any
time in the future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one
situation shall not be considered a waiver of the performance of the
provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.</p>
<p><strong>6.5</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is found void and
unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible
with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original
provision and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential
purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent
possible under law.</p>
